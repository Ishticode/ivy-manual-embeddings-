# ivy-manual-embeddings
Some embedding layer implementation using ivy library. Just for fun. It is based on [NYCTaxiFare dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tanyildizderya/nyctaxifares) from kaggle (smaller). Most of the feature extraction is similar to Jose Portilla's.
Uses [haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to extract the feature of distance (km) from a given latitude and longtitude of pickup and dropoff locations.
